_**Abstract**_

This project focuses on studying the different methods of machine learning to determine the best possible way to predict the indicator point to a successful Google App. Our main objective of the research is to understand the construction and functionality of Google application to help applications hit the market as a “trendy app”.We executed Machine Learning/Modeling procedures through Rstudio packages such as Reduced Rank Regression (RRR package tag) and Random Forest ( forest package tag) and functions like stepwise. For analytical purposes, we used packages like (....) to create the best informative and colorfully stimulating graphs that can be understood in one setting.
